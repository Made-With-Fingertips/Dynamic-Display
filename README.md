# Dynamic Display

## [DEPRECATED]

Samsung has added the ability to change both refresh rate and screen resolution to Bixby Routines. Because of this, I am no longer supporting Dynamic Display. It is still useful for 96Hz, but I have found the Bixby Routines method to be more reliable for 60Hz and 120Hz. I may update the app a few times to add future Samsung devices with high refresh rate displays to the supported devices list, but no new features are planned.
